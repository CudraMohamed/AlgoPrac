# Write a Python function named smallest that accepts a list of unsorted integers and returns the smallest number in the list. Example:

#1. Given a list L  and an index i, write code that will create a new
# list the same as L but with element N removed

# L=["a","e","i","o","u"]
# del L[2]
# j=[]
# for x in L:
#     j.append(x)
# print(j)

# 2. Given a list L and an index i, write code that will remove element
# N from L, in place (i.e., wonâ€™t create a new list)
# For example: L = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h],  N = 5  yields [a, b, c, d, e, g, h]


# 3. Given a list L, write code that will reverse the list.
# 4. Given a list L , write code that will reverse the list in place
# (i.e. wonâ€™t create a new list)
# For example: [1, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 1]
# L=["My",]
